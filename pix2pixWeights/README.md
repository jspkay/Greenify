# Zip compressed files
Github doesn't like much files over 100MB, so the obvious choice was to zip the needed files and separate the archive in 90MB parts.

## How to exctract
You just need to download all the files in this directory and open the ".zip" one (or the only one with an icon). Then your archive manager should be able to treat it as a normal archive.
